A [CSS file](tailwind-utility-classes.css) containing specific Tailwind utility classes for projects where a build step is impractical.

To limit the filesize, I only included the classes I use most often and only included the "sm" and "lg" responsive breakpoints.

To add/remove classes, edit the `safelist` in `tailwind.config.js` and rebuild the file.

Check out the [Tailwind safelist documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/content-configuration#safelisting-classes) for more information.

Tailwind preflight is not included.
